# Ubuntu-Rstudio-server-setup
Here's a bash script that'll get Rstudio server (preview 1.3) setup with Microsoft open R 3.5 under the hood. 

To use the script, make sure to give it execute permissions: chmod +x library_setup.sh
You can then run it with: yes Y |./library_setup.sh

That should agree to most of the installs. You may still have to stick around to agree to the rstudio and intel mkl agreements explicitly.
